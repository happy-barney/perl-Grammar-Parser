Grammar::Parser - Unified grammar API

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module started its life as part of L<< SQL::Admin >> after having
maintenance issues with L<< Parse::RecDescent >> grammars.

=over

=item it should support multiple backends using unified definition

There are plenty of grammar parsing modules around, each one with its own callbacks,
grammar definition, features, lifecycle, performance, ...

Having unified API makes easier to change backends (regardless of reason).

=item support related grammars / grammar inheritance

Every SQL database has its own dialect based on one of SQL standards.
Even every version of same product has different subset.

Maintaining their grammars and/or adding new one will be real pain without
possibility to reuse common parts.
